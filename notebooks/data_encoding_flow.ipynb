    "\n",
    "There are no field names (userName, favoriteNumber, interests). Instead, the encoded data contains _field tags_, which are numbers (1, 2, and 3).

    "## Schema Evolution for Thrift and Protobuf\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how Thrift and Protocol Buffers manage schema changes to ensure both _backward_ and _forward compatibility_.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the examples above, an encoded record comprises concatenated encoded fields. Each field is identified by a tag number (e.g., 1, 2, 3 in the sample schemas) and annotated with a datatype (such as string or integer). If a field value is not set, it is simply omitted from the encoded record. It's important to note that field tags play a crucial role in determining the meaning of the encoded data. Although you can modify a field's name in the schema without issues, changing a field's tag would render all existing encoded data invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding new fields to the schema is permissible, but it requires assigning each field a new tag number. Old code, which is unaware of the new tag numbers, can still read data written by new code, and if it encounters an unrecognized tag number, it can safely ignore that field. The datatype annotation allows the parser to determine the necessary bytes to skip, thus maintaining _forward compatibility_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding _backward compatibility_, as long as each field retains a unique tag number, new code can read old data successfully because the tag numbers retain their original meaning. However, when adding a new field, it cannot be made required since old code wouldn't have written this new field, causing compatibility issues. Hence, to ensure backward compatibility, **any fields added after the initial schema deployment must be optional or have default values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing a field follows a similar principle to adding one, but with backward and forward compatibility concerns reversed. Only optional fields can be removed, never required fields, and once a tag number is removed, it can't be reused to prevent conflicts with existing data written with the old tag number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the datatype of a field is possible, but it carries the risk of losing precision or truncating values. For instance, converting a 32-bit integer into a 64-bit integer may lead to data loss when old code reads data written by new code, as the old code uses a 32-bit variable to hold the value. If the 64-bit value exceeds the capacity of a 32-bit variable, it will be truncated. Thus, careful consideration is necessary when altering field datatypes, and consulting the documentation is advisable to understand potential implications."

    "  string userName;\n",
    "  union { null, long } favoriteNumber = null;\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent JSON representation of that schema is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"type\": \"record\",\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Person\",\n",
    "  \"fields\": [\n",
    "    { \"name\": \"userName\", \"type\": \"string\" },\n",
    "    { \"name\": \"favoriteNumber\", \"type\": [\"null\", \"long\"], \"default\": null },\n",
    "    { \"name\": \"interests\", \"type\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": \"string\" } }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The data encoded with this schema looks like this:\n",
    "![avro](../assets/avro.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, it's important to note that the schema lacks tag numbers. When we encode our sample record using this schema, the resulting Avro binary encoding is impressively compact, spanning just _32 bytes_—the most space-efficient among all the encodings we've observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the byte sequence, one can readily discern the _absence of field identifiers or datatype markers_. The encoding solely comprises concatenated values. For instance, a string is represented by a length prefix followed by UTF-8 bytes, but there are no explicit indicators within the encoded data to specify that it is, indeed, a string. In fact, it could be interpreted as an integer or any other data type altogether. Similarly, an integer is encoded using a variable-length encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly parse the binary data, you must traverse the fields in the order they appear in the schema and _refer to the schema_ itself to ascertain the datatype of each field. Consequently, the binary data can only be accurately decoded if the code reading the data employs the exact same schema as the code that wrote the data. Any deviation or mismatch in the schema between the reader and the writer would result in incorrectly decoded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Avro, data encoding and decoding are based on two schemas: the `writer's schema` used during data encoding and the `reader's schema` employed during data decoding. These schemas do not necessarily have to be identical but should be compatible. When decoding data, the Avro library compares the writer's and reader's schemas, resolving any discrepancies between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Avro specification ensures that fields in different orders between the writer's and reader's schemas pose no issues during resolution since schema matching occurs based on field names. If the reader's schema lacks a field present in the writer's schema, it is simply ignored. Conversely, if the reader's schema expects a field that the writer's schema does not contain, the missing field is filled in with a default value declared in the reader's schema. This allows for flexible schema evolution while maintaining data compatibility.\n",
