Data Encoding Format
• JSON
• XML
• Apache Thrift
• Protocol Buffers
• Apache Avro
• Apache Parquet
• Apache ORC
• Apache Arrow

JSON is more popular than XML as it is more compact.

**Apache Thrift** is a common framework for building scalable cross-language services. It provides a simple interface definition language (IDL) and code generation tools to create services in multiple programming languages.

**Protobufs** (Protocol Buffers) is another popular method for serializing structured data, developed by Google. It allows you to define your data structure using a simple language-agnostic syntax and then generates code for various programming languages to read and write that data.
