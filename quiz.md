### Q1: What is the primary advantage of using binary data encoding formats over textual formats like JSON or XML?

- A. Binary formats are more human-readable
- B. Binary formats are more efficient and compact
- C. Binary formats provide better support for Unicode character strings
- D. Binary formats are easier to work with for handling schema changes

### Q2: Which of the following is NOT a binary data encoding format?

- A. Apache Thrift
- B. Protocol Buffers
- C. Apache Avro
- D. JSON

### Q3: Which of the following data flow modes involves a sender putting messages into a queue and a receiver retrieving them in a FIFO manner?

- A. Service calls
- B. Message queues
- C. Publish-subscribe
- D. Databases

### Q4: What is the primary advantage of the GraphQL query language over traditional REST APIs?

- A. Provides better security for API interactions
- B. Allows clients to control the structure and data they receive
- C. Enables asynchronous communication between client and server
- D. Supports a wider range of data encoding formats

### Q5: What is the primary goal of schema evolution in data encoding formats?

- A. Ensure data consistency across multiple systems
- B. Improve data compression and reduce storage requirements
- C. Maintain compatibility when modifying or extending data schemas
- D. Optimize data encoding and decoding performance

### Q6: Which of the following is a key advantage of asynchronous message-passing systems compared to RPC?

- A. Lower latency for communication
- B. Decoupling of sender and receiver
- C. Better support for complex data structures
- D. Guaranteed message delivery

### Q7: What is the primary difference between message queues and publish-subscribe systems?

- A. Message queues involve direct communication, while publish-subscribe is indirect
- B. Message queues handle messages in a FIFO manner, while publish-subscribe does not
- C. Message queues broadcast messages to multiple receivers, while publish-subscribe sends messages to a single receiver
- D. Message queues are suitable for point-to-point communication, while publish-subscribe is better for broadcasting updates

### Q8: In the context of data encoding and schema evolution, what does backward compatibility refer to?

- A. Newer code can read data written by older code
- B. Older code can read data written by newer code
- C. Newer code can write data that can be read by older code
- D. Older code can write data that can be read by newer code

### Q9: What is the primary purpose of using a message broker in asynchronous message-passing systems?

- A. To temporarily store and forward messages between senders and receivers
- B. To ensure messages are delivered in a specific order (FIFO)
- C. To broadcast messages to multiple interested receivers
- D. To encode and decode messages between different data formats

### Q10: What is the primary purpose of using a columnar data format like Apache Parquet for big data analytics workloads?

- A. Efficient storage and processing of specific columns
- B. Better support for complex nested data structures
- C. Optimized for high-throughput data ingestion
- D. Improved data compression and reduced storage requirements
